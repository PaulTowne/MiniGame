# MiniGame
This is a side project that I worked on over Christmas break during my sophomore year. I wanted to practice my coding skills and decided to make a simple platformer game. The mechanics that I was able to implement include basic movement controlled by the "wasd" keys. There is also a simple "sprint" function as well. There is a health and weapon UI that can be toggled by pressing "e". Left clicking the mouse will cause an attack animation to play which can interact with the AI creatures that I implemented. The creatures have an AI that uses a pathing algorithm which allows creatures to find the quickest path to the player. The algorithm takes into account stationary "walls" or objects that could block the path. Everything in the game can collide and interact with the environment. The graphics in the game are very rudimentary, but the idea is that I would get mechanics working first and focus on graphics later.
